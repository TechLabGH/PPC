Hot water circulation pump controller

This is mqtt-based controller to run Hot Water Recirculating System.

It allows to start pump from multiple remotes placed in kitchen and bathrooms as well as schedule automatic run.

Communication is using MQTT broker to simplify adding new remotes (like HomeAssistant, phone app etc).

While this is trivial and staraight-forward solution, I hope you will find it interesting to start or odopt it to your project.
